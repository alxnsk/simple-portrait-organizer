No more "UltraHiRez 72Mb in size" **.png** files! 
No more, *or at least less*: pleas, tears, treats or social contracts during the pre-planning stage of your TRPG campaign!

This FoundryVTT module replaces the standard FilePicker window for non-GM users with a simple drag-and-drop interface, which **converts any provided image to WebP** format on the client side and **saves it in a location specified by the GM**.

All that, and it still looks less complicated than airplane controls, even for users who arenâ€™t that tech-savvy.

Simple.
